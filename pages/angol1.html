    <h3>When all hope seems lost...</h3>

            Marci stared sadly out the window as snowflakes gently drifted down. This was the first Christmas he had to
            spend without his father, who couldn’t come home due to a long trip abroad. His mother did everything she
            could to bring joy into their day, but somehow, the holiday felt empty.

            In the afternoon, as he walked through the streets decorated with Christmas lights, he noticed the cry of a
            little boy. The child said he had lost his favorite toy, a teddy bear, without which he couldn’t fall asleep.
            Marci didn’t hesitate and immediately helped him. He took the boy by the hand, and together they began
            searching for the toy. Finally, a shopkeeper mentioned that the bear had been left with him for safekeeping.

            The little boy’s parents were touched and thanked Marci for his help, inviting him in for hot chocolate.
            When Marci got home, his heart was filled with a warm sense of happiness. In the evening, when he turned on
            his phone, he found a video call from his father. Even though it was through a screen, they celebrated
            together, and Marci realized that Christmas miracles are not always loud but are always there.
