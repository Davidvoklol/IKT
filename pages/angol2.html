    <h3>An unexpected guest brings joy.</h3>

            For David, Christmas was never particularly exciting. This year was shaping up to be the same: dinner with
            the family, followed by dull conversations with the grandparents. But that morning, he received a strange
            text message from an old friend who hadn’t been in touch for years.
        </p>
        
        <p><i>"Will you be home tonight? I might drop by. - Kriszti"</i></p>
        
        <p>
            David’s heart skipped a beat. Kriszti was his childhood best friend, with whom he had once spent all his
            time. Life had pulled them apart during high school, but the thought that Kriszti might visit brightened his
            day. Suddenly, the family dinner seemed a bit more special.

            Kriszti really came. She entered the house with a box of chocolates in her hand, and David felt like they
            picked up right where they had left off. The conversation lasted until dawn. Kriszti shared everything that
            had happened in her life, and reminiscing about old memories created a true festive atmosphere. David
            realized that Christmas is about sharing joy with the people who matter.
